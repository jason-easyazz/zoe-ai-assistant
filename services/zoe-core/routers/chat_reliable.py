🧠 Memory Expert - for storing and retrieving information
📋 Planning Expert - for project management and roadmaps
💻 Development Expert - for code and technical tasks
🌤️ Weather Expert - for forecasts and conditions

😊 I track both explicit feedback (when you rate my responses) and implicit signals (like response time, task completion, and engagement patterns).

📈 I analyze satisfaction trends over time and identify what makes responses more helpful.

🎯 I adapt my communication style gradually based on your preferences and feedback patterns.

You can always provide feedback on my responses, and I'll use that to improve future interactions!"""
