## 📖 Usage Examples

### Creating a Journal Entry with Photos

```javascript
// Upload photos
const photos = await uploadPhotos([file1, file2]);

// Create entry
const entry = await createJournalEntry({
    title: "Amazing Day at the Beach",
    content: "Today was incredible...",
    photos: photos.map(p => p.url),
    people_ids: [1, 5],  // Tag Sarah and Mike
    place_tags: [{
        name: "Santa Monica Beach",
        lat: 34.0195,
        lng: -118.4912
    }],
    privacy_level: "inner_circle",
    mood: "happy",
    tags: ["beach", "summer", "friends"]
});
```

### Converting Bucket List Item to Journey

```javascript
// User clicks "Make this a journey" on bucket list item
const journey = await fetch(`/api/journeys/from-bucket-item/123?user_id=default`, {
    method: 'POST'
});

// Add stops
await fetch(`/api/journeys/${journey.journey_id}/stops`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        title: "Paris",
        location: "Paris, France",
        location_coords: { lat: 48.8566, lng: 2.3522 },
        planned_date: "2025-11-01",
        emoji: "🗼"
    })
});
```

### Journey Check-in

```javascript
// At journey location, click "Check In"
const checkin = await createJourneyCheckin(journeyId, {
    title: "Arrived in Paris!",
    content: "Just landed at CDG. The city is beautiful...",
    photos: [photo1Url, photo2Url],
    mood: "excited",
    place_tags: [{
        name: "Charles de Gaulle Airport",
        lat: 49.0097,
        lng: 2.5479
    }]
});
// Automatically: 
// - Creates journal entry
// - Links to current journey stop
// - Marks stop as completed
// - Advances to next stop
// - Syncs to Zoe's memory
```

### Using Journal Prompts

```javascript
// On page load
const prompts = await loadJournalPrompts();

// Display: "How was your coffee with Sarah?"
// User clicks "Write About It"

// Form opens pre-filled with:
// - Title: "Coffee with Sarah"
// - People tag: Sarah (ID: 5)
// - Context from calendar event
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Entry Creation Flow
```
User writes entry
    → Upload photos (if any) → /api/media/upload
    → Create entry → /api/journal/entries
    → Calculate word count & read time
    → Link people via journal_entry_people table
    → Sync to temporal memory (async, non-blocking)
    → Reload timeline
```

### Journey Check-in Flow
```
User clicks "Check In" on journey
    → Open modal with journey context
    → User writes & uploads photos
    → POST /api/journeys/{id}/checkin
    → Create journal entry with journey_id & stop_id
    → Mark current stop as completed
    → Set actual_date on stop
    → Advance next stop to "current"
    → Update journey status to "active"
    → Return to journey view (refreshed)
```

### "On This Day" Flow
```
Page load
    → GET /api/journal/entries/on-this-day
    → Query: entries where month=10 AND day=10 AND year!=2025
