# Quick Fix Summary

## Current Status
✅ Backend is online and healthy  
✅ Data migrated to your user  
❌ Session auth helper function uses wrong endpoint  

## The Problem
The `get_user_from_session()` helper function tries to call:
```
http://zoe-auth:8002/api/auth/session/{session_id}
```

But this endpoint doesn't exist! The auth service has `/api/auth/sessions` which works differently.

## Quick Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Query Parameter (FASTEST)
Keep using `user_id = Query("default")` but have frontend send the user_id from session.

### Option 2: Fix Auth Endpoint
Add the missing endpoint to auth service.

###  Option 3: Use Existing Session Manager
The core service has its own session_manager - use that instead.

## Recommended: Revert to Working State
For now, let's revert the session auth changes and use a simpler approach - pass user_id from frontend where session data is already available.

Would you like me to:
1. **Revert to stable** (use Query with frontend sending user_id)  
2. **Fix the auth endpoint** (add missing endpoint)
3. **Use local session manager** (use core's session manager)
