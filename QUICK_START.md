## 🐛 If Tests Still Fail

### Problem: MEM agent not showing 9 experts
```bash
# Check if service restarted
docker ps | grep mem-agent

# Check logs
docker logs mem-agent --tail 50

# Force rebuild if needed
docker-compose up -d --build mem-agent
```

### Problem: API errors in logs
```bash
# Check if zoe-core-test is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Restart zoe-core-test
docker-compose restart zoe-core-test
```

### Problem: Still getting safety filter responses
- This means experts aren't executing actions
- Check logs: `docker logs mem-agent | grep -i error`
- Verify expert loaded: `curl http://localhost:11435/health`
