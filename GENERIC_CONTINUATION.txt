I need to continue working on my Zoe AI Assistant.

Please:
1. Check my GitHub: https://github.com/jason-easyazz/zoe-ai-assistant
2. Read CLAUDE_CURRENT_STATE.md
3. Tell me what's working and what's next
4. Let me pick what to work on

Always provide complete copy-paste scripts that:
- Start with cd /home/pi/zoe
- Include full file contents
- Update GitHub after success
- Test immediately
