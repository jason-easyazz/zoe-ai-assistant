# 🎯 Cursor Context Awareness System - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Purpose**: Prevent duplicate work and ensure AI assistants know what's been done

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

To answer your question: **"Is Cursor forced to check anything to see what's been done recently?"**

Yes! We now have a **3-layer context system**:

### **Layer 1: RECENT_CHANGES.md** ⭐ PRIMARY
**File**: `/home/pi/zoe/RECENT_CHANGES.md`

- 📅 **Updated**: After every major change
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Quick snapshot of recent work
- ✅ **Contains**:
  - What was done this week
  - New tools created
  - Breaking changes
  - Active work (to avoid conflicts)
  - "Don't Duplicate" list

**Cursor/AI should ALWAYS read this file FIRST before starting new work!**

---

### **Layer 2: Context Briefing Script** 🤖 AUTOMATED
**File**: `/home/pi/zoe/scripts/utilities/context_briefing.sh`

**Run**: `./scripts/utilities/context_briefing.sh`

**Shows in 30 seconds**:
- Recent changes summary
- Last 7 days activity (from git)
- Repository health
- Last 10 commits
- Recent version tags
- Uncommitted changes
- Structure compliance status
- Available tools list

---

### **Layer 3: Weekly Summaries** 📊 HISTORICAL
**Command**: `./tools/reports/weekly_summary.sh [weeks_ago]`

**Shows**:
- Commits by type (feat, fix, db, docs)
- Contributors
- Files changed
- Lines added/removed
- Tags created

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Before Cursor Starts New Work**:

```bash
# STEP 1: Read recent changes (CRITICAL!)
cat /home/pi/zoe/RECENT_CHANGES.md

# STEP 2: Run context briefing
./scripts/utilities/context_briefing.sh

# STEP 3: Check for existing features
grep -r "feature_name" /home/pi/zoe/
```

### **What Cursor Will See**:

```markdown
## 🆕 This Week

- ❌ Weekly summaries (EXISTS)
- ❌ Repository health dashboard (EXISTS)
```

## 📊 Quick Reference

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What changed recently? | `cat RECENT_CHANGES.md` |
| Full context | `./scripts/utilities/context_briefing.sh` |
| Last week | `./tools/reports/weekly_summary.sh` |
| Repository health | `python3 tools/reports/repo_health.py` |
| Structure check | `python3 tools/audit/enforce_structure.py` |

## 🎓 Example Scenario

**User**: "Add a tool to track weekly progress"

**Good AI Response** ✅:
```
Let me check if this exists first...

[Reads RECENT_CHANGES.md]
Found: "✅ Weekly summaries (exists)"

[Checks tools directory]
Found: ./tools/reports/weekly_summary.sh

This feature already exists! 
Run: ./tools/reports/weekly_summary.sh

Would you like me to:
1. Show you how to use it?
2. Enhance the existing tool?
3. Create a different tracking feature?
```

**Bad AI Response** ❌:
```
I'll create a weekly progress tracker...
[Creates duplicate of existing tool]
[Wastes time and creates confusion]
```

---

## 🚨 Critical Files to Always Check

### **Before Any New Work**:
1. `RECENT_CHANGES.md` - What was done recently
2. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current system state
3. `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RULES.md` - Governance rules
4. `docs/guides/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md` - How to commit

### **To Find Existing Features**:
```bash
# Search tools
ls -R tools/

# Search scripts
ls -R scripts/

# Search codebase
grep -r "feature_name" /home/pi/zoe/

# Check documentation
grep -r "topic" /home/pi/zoe/docs/
```
