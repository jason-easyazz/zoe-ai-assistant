## 🎯 Real-World Example

**Before (Generic Zoe):**
> User: "add milk"
> Zoe: "I can help you add milk. To which list would you like to add it?"

**After Training (Your Zoe):**
> User: "add milk"
> Zoe: [TOOL_CALL:add_to_list:{"list_name":"shopping","task_text":"milk"}]
> Zoe: "Added milk to your shopping list! 🛒"

**Why?** Because you corrected it once, and Zoe learned your pattern.
