## 🎓 Key Research Findings

### What the Research Showed
1. **Temporal knowledge graphs** (Zep) outperform pure vector search by 9% (74% vs 65%)
2. **Natural language memory** (L1) bridges gap between vectors and personalization
3. **Pre-response validation** reduces hallucinations 40-60%
4. **Confidence expression** builds user trust without accuracy loss
5. **Platform-aware context** maximizes resource utilization

### What We Decided
1. **Extend Light RAG** with temporal weighting (don't replace with Zep)
2. **Implement L1 behavioral memory** before fine-tuning (80% benefit, 20% complexity)
3. **Add validation layer** to intent system (high impact, minimal changes)
4. **Surface confidence transparently** to users (trust building)
5. **Defer GraphRAG/DPO** to P2 (validate need first)

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### ✅ What Will Make This Succeed
1. **Start with P0-2** (quickest win, proves approach)
2. **Measure everything** (baseline → target metrics)
3. **Incremental validation** (don't proceed until P0 stable)
4. **Build on foundation** (extend, don't rewrite)

### ❌ What Will Make This Fail
1. **Rewriting working systems** (intent system is solid)
2. **Premature optimization** (GraphRAG/DPO before validating need)
3. **Ignoring constraints** (Pi 5 has 4K limit)
4. **Adding complexity** for its own sake
