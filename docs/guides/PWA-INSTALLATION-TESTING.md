## üß™ Browser Console Testing

// Run in browser console
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(reg => {

    console.log('Scope:', reg?.scope);
    console.log('State:', reg?.active?.state);
});
```

### Test Push Notification Permission

```javascript
// Check notification permission
console.log('Notification permission:', Notification.permission);

// Request permission (if not already granted)
if (Notification.permission === 'default') {
    Notification.requestPermission().then(permission => {
        console.log('New permission:', permission);
    });
}
```

            cache.keys().then(requests => {
                console.log(`${name}: ${requests.length} items`);

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Install" button doesn't appear (Android)

**Causes:**
- Not served over HTTPS
- Service worker not registered
- Manifest.json not found
- Already installed

**Solutions:**
1. Check URL is HTTPS (Cloudflare tunnel provides this)
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Console ‚Üí look for SW errors
3. Visit `/manifest.json` directly ‚Üí should load JSON
4. Check if already installed: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí "Zoe"

### Can't Add to Home Screen (iOS)

**Causes:**
- Not using Safari (use Safari, not Chrome/Firefox)
- Share button not visible
- Device running iOS older than 11.3

**Solutions:**
1. Must use Safari browser
2. Tap Share button (bottom of screen on iPhone, top on iPad)
3. If Share button missing, check iOS Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Restrictions
4. Update iOS to latest version

### App opens in browser, not standalone

**Causes:**
- Opened from browser bookmark instead of home screen icon
- Display mode not set in manifest
- Cache issue

**Solutions:**
1. Delete and reinstall
2. Clear Safari/Chrome cache
3. Make sure you're tapping HOME SCREEN icon, not bookmark

### Service Worker not registering

**Causes:**
- JavaScript error on page
- /sw.js file not found (404)
- Browser doesn't support service workers
- Mixed content (HTTP + HTTPS)

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if sw.js is accessible
curl https://zoe.yourname.com/sw.js

# Should return JavaScript code, not 404
```

### Icons look wrong

**Causes:**
- Cache not cleared after icon update
- Wrong icon path in manifest
- Icon generation failed

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Regenerate icons
cd /home/pi/zoe
./scripts/utilities/generate-pwa-icons.sh

# Check icons exist
ls -lh /home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-ui/dist/icons/

# Should see: icon-192.png, icon-512.png, etc.
```
