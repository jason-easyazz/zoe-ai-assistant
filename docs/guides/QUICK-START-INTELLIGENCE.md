## üéØ How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Chat Normally

Just use Zoe as you always do! Every interaction is automatically logged.

### Step 2: Give Feedback

After each Zoe response, click:
- üëç if it was good
- üëé if it was poor  
- ‚úèÔ∏è if you want to correct it

**The more feedback you give, the smarter Zoe gets!**

### Step 3: Check Progress

Open Settings ‚Üí AI Training & Learning to see:
- How many examples collected
- When next training runs
- Training history

**That's it!** Zoe learns while you sleep.

## üîß Advanced: Enable Full Training

**Currently:** System collects data but doesn't train yet (needs Unsloth)

**To enable actual overnight training:**

```bash
# Install Unsloth (one-time)
pip install unsloth

# Set up nightly training (one-time)
sudo crontab -e
# Add line: 0 2 * * * /home/pi/zoe/scripts/train/nightly_training.sh

# Verify setup
python3 /home/pi/zoe/scripts/train/test_training_setup.py
```

**Without Unsloth:**
- ‚úÖ Feedback system works
- ‚úÖ Data collection works
- ‚úÖ Training data saved
- ‚ùå No actual model training
- ‚úÖ Data ready for future training

**With Unsloth:**
- ‚úÖ Everything above PLUS
- ‚úÖ Actual overnight training
- ‚úÖ Model adapters created
- ‚úÖ Continuous improvement

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Give Quality Feedback

**Good Examples:**
- ‚úèÔ∏è Correct when Zoe misunderstands
- üëç When tool calls work perfectly
- üëé When responses are off-topic

**Less Useful:**
- Random thumbs up/down
- No corrections when mistakes happen
- Inconsistent feedback

### Be Specific in Corrections

**Good Correction:**
> "Add bread and milk to shopping list"

**Less Useful:**
> "do it right"

### Use Zoe Regularly

More interactions = better training data = smarter Zoe

Aim for 20-30 interactions per day for best results.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Feedback buttons not responding?

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors (F12)
2. Backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
3. Network tab shows POST to `/api/chat/feedback/...`

**Fix:**
- Reload page
- Clear browser cache
- Restart backend

### Training stats showing 0?

**Possible causes:**
1. Haven't chatted yet today
2. Backend restarted (data is in database, just reload)
3. Database permissions issue

**Check:**
```bash
ls -lh /app/data/training.db
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_examples;"
```

### Want to see what's being collected?

```bash
# View all training examples
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT user_input, feedback_type, weight FROM training_examples ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# View corrections only
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT user_input, zoe_output, corrected_output FROM training_examples WHERE feedback_type='correction';"
```

## üéì Understanding the System

### What Gets Trained

**‚úÖ Learns:**
- Your communication style
- Common shortcuts ("bread" ‚Üí shopping list)
- Tool calling patterns
- When to use which memory
- Error patterns to avoid

**‚ùå Doesn't Learn:**
- Your private data (stays in memory system)
- Other users' patterns (user-specific)
- Things you tell it not to

### Data Privacy

- ‚úÖ All data stays on your Pi
- ‚úÖ Never sent to cloud
- ‚úÖ User-specific (isolated)
- ‚úÖ Can export/delete anytime

### Model Switching

**Q:** What if I switch from llama3.2 to gemma3?

**A:**
- LoRA adapter won't work (model-specific)
- BUT training data is portable!
- Export data before switching
- Retrain new model on same data
