**Your feedback trains Zoe tonight at 2am!**

### 3. **Graph Intelligence** (Active Now!)
Zoe can now understand relationships:
- How people are connected
- Related projects and ideas
- Knowledge networks
- Suggested connections

### 4. **Model Management** (Active Now!)
CLI tool to manage models and training:
```bash
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py list
```

### 5. **Training Dashboard** (Active Now!)
Settings → AI Training & Learning shows:
- Examples collected today
- Training history
- Current model/adapter
- Export/import training data

## 🎯 How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Chat Normally

Just use Zoe as you always do! Every interaction is automatically logged.

### Step 2: Give Feedback

After each Zoe response, click:
- 👍 if it was good
- 👎 if it was poor  
- ✏️ if you want to correct it

**The more feedback you give, the smarter Zoe gets!**

### Step 3: Check Progress

Open Settings → AI Training & Learning to see:
- How many examples collected
- When next training runs
- Training history

**That's it!** Zoe learns while you sleep.

## 📈 What to Expect

### First Week:
- Zoe collects 50-150 interactions
- You provide 5-10 corrections
- System prepares for first training

### Second Week:
- Friday night: First training run (if 20+ examples)
- Saturday morning: Wake up to slightly smarter Zoe
- Notice fewer repeated mistakes

### First Month:
- 20-30 training runs
- Noticeably better at YOUR specific use cases
- More personalized responses
- Better tool calling accuracy

### After 3 Months:
- Highly personalized to your patterns
- Anticipates your needs
- Seamless experience
- Feels like Zoe "knows you"

## 🔧 Advanced: Enable Full Training

**Currently:** System collects data but doesn't train yet (needs Unsloth)

**To enable actual overnight training:**

```bash
# Install Unsloth (one-time)
pip install unsloth

# Set up nightly training (one-time)
sudo crontab -e
# Add line: 0 2 * * * /home/pi/zoe/scripts/train/nightly_training.sh

# Verify setup
python3 /home/pi/zoe/scripts/train/test_training_setup.py
```

**Without Unsloth:**
- ✅ Feedback system works
- ✅ Data collection works
- ✅ Training data saved
- ❌ No actual model training
- ✅ Data ready for future training

**With Unsloth:**
- ✅ Everything above PLUS
- ✅ Actual overnight training
- ✅ Model adapters created
- ✅ Continuous improvement

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Give Quality Feedback

**Good Examples:**
- ✏️ Correct when Zoe misunderstands
- 👍 When tool calls work perfectly
- 👎 When responses are off-topic

**Less Useful:**
- Random thumbs up/down
- No corrections when mistakes happen
- Inconsistent feedback

### Be Specific in Corrections

**Good Correction:**
> "Add bread and milk to shopping list"

**Less Useful:**
> "do it right"

### Use Zoe Regularly

More interactions = better training data = smarter Zoe

Aim for 20-30 interactions per day for best results.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Feedback buttons not responding?

**Check:**
1. Browser console for errors (F12)
2. Backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
3. Network tab shows POST to `/api/chat/feedback/...`

**Fix:**
- Reload page
- Clear browser cache
- Restart backend

### Training stats showing 0?

**Possible causes:**
1. Haven't chatted yet today
2. Backend restarted (data is in database, just reload)
3. Database permissions issue

**Check:**
```bash
ls -lh /app/data/training.db
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_examples;"
```

### Want to see what's being collected?

```bash
# View all training examples
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT user_input, feedback_type, weight FROM training_examples ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# View corrections only
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT user_input, zoe_output, corrected_output FROM training_examples WHERE feedback_type='correction';"
```

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### What Gets Trained

**✅ Learns:**
- Your communication style
- Common shortcuts ("bread" → shopping list)
- Tool calling patterns
- When to use which memory
- Error patterns to avoid

**❌ Doesn't Learn:**
- Your private data (stays in memory system)
- Other users' patterns (user-specific)
- Things you tell it not to

### Data Privacy

- ✅ All data stays on your Pi
- ✅ Never sent to cloud
- ✅ User-specific (isolated)
- ✅ Can export/delete anytime

### Model Switching

**Q:** What if I switch from llama3.2 to gemma3?

**A:**
- LoRA adapter won't work (model-specific)
- BUT training data is portable!
- Export data before switching
- Retrain new model on same data
