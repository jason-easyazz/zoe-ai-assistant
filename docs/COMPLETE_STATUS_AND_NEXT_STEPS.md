## ❌ BLOCKERS TO 100% (2 remaining tests)

### Blocker #1: Database Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: `people` table schema doesn't match code expectations

**Actual Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    id INTEGER, user_id TEXT, name TEXT,
    profile JSON,           -- Contains: relationship, phone, email
    facts JSON,             -- Contains: notes, interests
    important_dates JSON    -- Contains: birthday, anniversary
)
```

**Code Expects**:
```sql
-- Trying to SELECT/INSERT these columns (they don't exist!):
relationship, birthday, phone, email, notes, avatar_url, tags, metadata
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ GET /api/memories/?type=people crashes
- ❌ POST /api/memories/?type=people crashes  
- ❌ PersonExpert can't create people
- ❌ PersonExpert can't search people

**Fix Needed**:
Update `memories.py` to work with actual schema:
- Read/write relationship from profile JSON
- Read/write birthday from important_dates JSON
- Read/write notes from facts JSON

**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

### Blocker #2: Temporal Memory Context Recall

**Problem**: "What did I just ask?" doesn't reference previous messages

**Status**: Temporal episodes are being created ✅, but not recalled

**Fix Needed**:
- Fetch previous messages from temporal memory
- Add to system prompt as context
- Show user what they asked before

**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes
