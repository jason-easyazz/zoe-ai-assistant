## Why Archived?

These files were development prototypes, test pages, and experimental designs that are no longer actively used:
- The production implementations have superseded these prototypes
- Test files served their purpose during development
- Keeping them in the main dist/ directory violated clean architecture principles

## Current Production Files

The active production UI files are:
- `chat.html` - Main chat interface
- `calendar.html` - Production calendar
- `memories.html` - Production memories interface
- `dashboard.html` - Main dashboard
- etc.

## Notes

- All files archived here are fully functional snapshots from development
- Archived for historical reference and potential future inspiration
- Not maintained or updated
- Use git history for detailed change tracking
