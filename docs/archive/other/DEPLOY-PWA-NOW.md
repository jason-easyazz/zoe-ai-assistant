## 📋 Deployment Steps (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Database Schema

```bash
cd /home/pi/zoe
sqlite3 /home/pi/zoe/data/zoe.db < /home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core/db/schema/push_subscriptions.sql
```

**What this does:**
- Creates `push_subscriptions` table
- Creates `notification_preferences` table
- Creates `notification_log` table
- Creates indexes for performance

**Verify:**
```bash
sqlite3 /home/pi/zoe/data/zoe.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE '%push%';"
# Should show: push_subscriptions
```

---

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

If using Docker:
```bash
docker exec zoe-core pip install py-vapid==1.9.1 pywebpush==2.0.0
```

If running locally:
```bash
cd /home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What this does:**
- Installs py-vapid (VAPID key generation)
- Installs pywebpush (Web Push protocol)

**Verify:**
```bash
docker exec zoe-core pip list | grep -E "py-vapid|pywebpush"
# Should show both packages
```

---

### Step 3: Restart Zoe Core

```bash
docker restart zoe-core
```

**Wait 10 seconds for services to start...**

**What this does:**
- Loads new push notification router
- Starts calendar reminder service
- Starts task reminder service
- Auto-generates VAPID keys on first run

**Verify:**
```bash
docker logs zoe-core --tail 20
# Should see:
# ✅ Calendar reminder service started
# ✅ Task reminder service started
```

---

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Get VAPID public key (proves push API is working)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/push/vapid-public-key

# Should return: {"publicKey":"...long base64 string..."}
```

If you see the public key → **Success! 🎉**

---

### Step 5: Test in Browser

1. Visit Zoe: `https://your-zoe-url.com`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run these commands:

```javascript
// Check if push is supported
console.log('Push supported:', zoePushNotifications.isSupported());

// Check permission
console.log('Permission:', zoePushNotifications.getPermissionStatus());

// Subscribe to notifications (will ask for permission)
await zoePushNotifications.subscribe();

// Send test notification
await zoePushNotifications.sendTest();
```

**Expected result:**
- Permission dialog appears
- You grant permission
- Test notification appears on your device
- Notification says: "If you see this, push notifications are working!"

## 🎯 How It Works

### Calendar Reminders:
```
1. You have meeting at 3:00 PM
2. At 2:45 PM → Zoe sends push notification
3. Your phone buzzes: "📅 Meeting with Sarah in 15 min"
4. Tap notification → Opens Zoe to calendar event
5. Works even if Zoe app is closed!
```

### Task Alerts:
```
1. Task "Buy milk" due tomorrow
2. 24 hours before → Zoe sends push notification
3. Your phone buzzes: "✅ Task Due Soon: Buy milk"
4. Tap notification → Opens Zoe to shopping list
```

### Behind the Scenes:
- Calendar service checks every 60 seconds
- Task service checks every 5 minutes
- Respects your quiet hours
- Tracks which notifications were sent
- Auto-retries failed sends
- Removes expired subscriptions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Test notification doesn't appear"

**Check:**
```bash
# 1. Check if zoe-core is running
docker ps | grep zoe-core

# 2. Check zoe-core logs for errors
docker logs zoe-core --tail 50

# 3. Test VAPID key endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/push/vapid-public-key

# 4. Check database tables exist
sqlite3 /home/pi/zoe/data/zoe.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM push_subscriptions;"
```

**Solutions:**
- Restart zoe-core: `docker restart zoe-core`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify notification permission is "granted"
- Try in incognito/private window

### "Permission denied"

Browser blocked notifications. To fix:
- **Chrome:** Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Notifications → Allow
- **Safari:** Settings → Safari → [Your Site] → Notifications → Allow

### "VAPID key not found"

The service generates keys automatically on first API call.

**Force generation:**
```bash
docker exec -it zoe-core python3 -c "
from services.push_notification_service import get_push_service
service = get_push_service()
print('Public Key:', service.get_public_key())
"
```

### "Router not found"

The router loader should auto-discover it, but verify:
```bash
grep -r "from routers import push" /home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core/main.py
```

If not found, the router loader will still discover it automatically.
