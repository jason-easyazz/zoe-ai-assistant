## 🚀 **TEST NOW**

### **1. Open Chat Interface:**
```
https://zoe.local/chat.html
```

### **2. Type This:**
```
Help me plan my day
```

### **3. Watch the Magic:**

You should see:

1. **🔄 Real-Time Orchestration:**
   ```
   🔄 Breaking down your request...
   
   📋 I'll coordinate 5 experts:
      1. 🗓️ Calendar expert → Get today's events and free time
      2. 📝 Lists expert → Get pending tasks
      3. ⏰ Reminder expert → Get reminders
      4. 🧠 Memory expert → Find birthdays, calls to make
      5. 📊 Planning expert → Synthesize comprehensive plan
   ```

2. **Progress Updates:**
   ```
   🗓️ Calendar expert working...
      ✅ Found 9 events, 0 hours free today
   
   📝 Lists expert working...
      ✅ Found 12 pending tasks (3 high priority)
   
   [... and so on for each expert ...]
   ```

3. **📅 Your Daily Plan:**
   ```
   **Your Daily Plan**
   
   📅 Today's Schedule:
   • 4:00 AM - What's on my shopping list?
   • 5:00 AM - Event
   • 7:00 AM - Event
   • 10:00 AM - Appointment
   [... all your events ...]
   ```

4. **💡 Interactive Action Cards** (if you have pending tasks):
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 🎯 Finish project proposal (High)       │
   │ Estimated: 2 hours                      │
   │ [📅 Add to Calendar ▼] [⏰ Remind Me]  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

5. **⏰ Click "Add to Calendar":**
   - See available time slots
   - Pick a time (e.g., "10:00 AM - 12:00 PM")

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Issue:**
- UI container was crashing with: `host not found in upstream "zoe-core"`
- Container is named `zoe-core-test` but nginx.conf was looking for `zoe-core`

### **Fix Applied:**
Updated `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-ui/nginx.conf`:
```nginx
# Before:
proxy_pass http://zoe-core:8000/api/;

# After:
proxy_pass http://zoe-core-test:8000/api/;
```

### **Result:**
✅ UI container now starts successfully  
✅ No DNS errors  
✅ Nginx running on 4 worker processes  

---

## 📊 **SYSTEM STATUS**

```bash
$ docker ps | grep zoe-
zoe-ui           Up 1 minute      ✅ RUNNING
zoe-core-test    Up 10 minutes    ✅ RUNNING
mem-agent        Up 15 minutes    ✅ RUNNING (healthy)
```

## 📝 **DOCUMENTATION**

Full documentation created:
1. **`ORCHESTRATION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Complete system overview
2. **`NATURAL_LANGUAGE_TEST_RESULTS.md`** - Backend test results
3. **`READY_TO_TEST.md`** - This file (web testing guide)

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

1. **List Expert** - Sometimes fails to retrieve tasks (API issue, not orchestration)
2. **Planning Phrases** - "What should I do today?" doesn't trigger orchestration (could add more phrases)
3. **No Tasks/Events** - Action cards only appear if you have pending tasks

---

## 💡 **OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **Expand Planning Phrases** - Add more natural language variations
2. **Use LLM for Detection** - Replace keyword matching with AI intent detection
3. **Fix List API** - Ensure tasks always load correctly
4. **Add Custom Time Picker** - Modal for manual time selection
