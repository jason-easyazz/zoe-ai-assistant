# ✅ Check This Tomorrow Morning

## 🌅 After Your First Overnight Training (Started 10pm)

### Quick Check:
```bash
# Run this command to see what happened overnight:
/home/pi/zoe/tools/verify-intelligence.sh
```

### Detailed Logs:

**1. Training Log (2:00 AM run):**
```bash
tail -50 /var/log/zoe-training.log
```

**What to look for:**
- `🌙 Starting nightly training...`
- `📊 Found X training examples`
- `🏋️ Training started...` (if 20+ examples)
- `⏭️ Only X examples, skipping training` (if < 20)
- `✅ Training completed` or error messages

**2. Memory Consolidation (1:30 AM run):**
```bash
tail -50 /var/log/zoe-consolidation.log
```

**What to look for:**
- `📝 Creating daily summary...`
- `✅ Daily summary created: X chars`
- Summary of your activities

**3. Check Training Database:**
```bash
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_examples;"
```

**What to expect:**
- Should show more examples than today (currently 7)

**4. Check for New Adapter:**
```bash
ls -la /home/pi/zoe/models/adapters/
```

**What to look for:**
- If 20+ examples: `adapter_20251011/` directory
- If < 20 examples: No new adapter (needs more data)
