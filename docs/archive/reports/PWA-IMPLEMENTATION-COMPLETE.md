## 🧪 Test Push Notifications

### After Deployment:

1. **Visit Zoe in browser:**
   ```
   https://your-zoe-url.com
   ```

2. **Grant notification permission when asked**

3. **Open browser console (F12):**
   ```javascript
   // Check if subscribed
   await zoePushNotifications.isSubscribed()
   
   // Send test notification
   await zoePushNotifications.sendTest()
   ```

4. **You should see:**
   - Test notification appears on your device
   - Notification says: "If you see this, push notifications are working!"
   - Clicking notification opens Zoe dashboard

### Test from Command Line:

```bash
# Get VAPID public key
curl http://localhost:8000/api/push/vapid-public-key

# Should return: {"publicKey":"..."} 
```

## 📱 User Experience After Deployment

### First Time Setup:
1. User visits Zoe (via Cloudflare tunnel)
2. Zoe asks: "Allow notifications?"
3. User taps "Allow"
4. Zoe auto-subscribes in background
5. Done! Notifications enabled

### Daily Usage:
- **15 min before meeting** → 📅 "Meeting with Sarah in 15 min"
