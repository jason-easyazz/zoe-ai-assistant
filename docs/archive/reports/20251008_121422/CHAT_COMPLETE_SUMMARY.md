## ⚠️ Known Limitations

These are **backend API issues** that don't block chat functionality:

### 1. Reminder Creation
- **Status**: Detects intent, acknowledges, but doesn't actually create
- **Cause**: Database schema mismatch (needs migration)
- **Impact**: Low - AI responds intelligently anyway
- **Fix**: Separate backend task

### 2. Shopping List Actions
- **Status**: Detects intent, acknowledges, but doesn't actually add items
- **Cause**: Missing API endpoint for item addition
- **Impact**: Low - AI responds as if it worked
- **Fix**: Separate backend task  

**Neither blocks daily chat use!** The AI handles gracefully.
