## 🚀 How to Use

### Access Methods
1. Click "⚡ LangGraph Enhanced" button in classic chat
2. Navigate directly to `/chat-langgraph.html`
3. Use the navigation menu

### Toggle Controls
- **🤖 Agents**: ON/OFF - Enable/disable multi-agent workflows
- **📊 Viz**: ON/OFF - Enable/disable visualization panel
- **🔙 Classic**: Return to standard chat

### Example Workflows

**Simple Request:**
```
"What's the weather like today?"
→ Standard AI response (no agents needed)
```

**Complex Request:**
```
"Plan a family movie night for Friday"
→ Triggers multi-agent workflow:
   1. Planner creates execution plan
   2. Executor checks calendar
   3. Specialist finds movie options
   4. Executor creates event
   5. Executor adds to shopping list
   6. Validator confirms completion
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

- **Initial Planning**: 0.5-2 seconds
- **Step Execution**: 0.3-5 seconds each
- **Graph Rendering**: <100ms
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time with minimal latency
- **Session Isolation**: Complete user privacy

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ User-isolated sessions
- ✅ Privacy-respecting agent constraints
- ✅ Action validation before execution
- ✅ Secure state management
- ✅ No cross-user data leakage

## 📈 Advanced Capabilities

### Intelligent Routing
- Analyzes message complexity
- Routes to appropriate agent types
- Optimizes execution path

### Dependency Management
- Identifies step dependencies
- Enables parallel execution
- Calculates critical path

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation to standard chat
- Rollback strategies for failures
- Detailed error reporting

### Visualization
- Mermaid graph generation
- Real-time status updates
- Interactive workflow display
