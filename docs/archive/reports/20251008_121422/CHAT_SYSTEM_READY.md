## 🎨 **HOW TO TEST**

### **Option 1: Through the UI (Recommended)**
1. Open: `http://localhost/`
2. Click the Zoe orb
3. Type: "Hello! What can you help me with?"
4. Watch the AI response appear

### **Option 2: Via API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello! What enhancement systems do you have?"}'
```

### **Option 3: Run Test Script**
```bash
/home/pi/test_chat_ui.sh
```

---

## 🔧 **AVAILABLE ENDPOINTS**

| Endpoint | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `GET /health` | Service health check | ✅ Working |
| `GET /api/chat/capabilities` | List all features | ✅ Working |
| `GET /api/chat/status` | Enhancement status | ✅ Working |
| `POST /api/chat` | Non-streaming chat | ✅ Working |
| `POST /api/chat/stream` | Streaming chat (SSE) | ✅ Ready |

---

## 🛡️ **PREVENTION MEASURES ACTIVE**

### **Multiple layers protecting against future issues:**

1. **`.cursorrules` Enhanced** (257 lines)
   - Explicit rules against multiple routers
   - Enhancement integration requirements
   - File naming conventions

2. **Architecture Tests** (`test_architecture.py`)
   - 5/5 tests passing
   - Automatically checks for violations
   - Run with: `python3 zoe/test_architecture.py`

3. **Pre-commit Hook** (Active)
   - Blocks commits with violations
   - Runs architecture tests automatically
   - Located: `/home/pi/zoe/.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Result:** ✅ **Cannot create duplicate routers anymore!**

## 🧪 **TRY THESE QUERIES**

### **Test Enhancement Systems:**

1. **Temporal Memory:**
   ```
   "Remember that I like Python programming"
   "What did I just tell you I like?"
   ```

2. **Complex Task (Orchestration):**
   ```
   "Schedule a meeting tomorrow and add it to my task list"
   ```

3. **Capabilities Query:**
   ```
   "What enhancement systems do you have available?"
   "Tell me about your features"
   ```

4. **General Chat:**
   ```
   "Hello! How can you help me?"
   "What can you do for me?"
   ```
