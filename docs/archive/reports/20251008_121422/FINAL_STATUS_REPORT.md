## 🔍 **CURRENT LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED**

### **⚠️ Chat Integration Gap**
**Issue**: While all enhancement systems are functional via API, the web chat interface is using simplified responses ("✅ Action executed by memory expert") instead of full conversational integration.

**Root Cause**: The existing chat system uses a different temporal memory integration (`temporal_memory_integration.py`) that conflicts with the new enhancement systems.

**Impact**: Users can access enhancement features through API calls, but the chat experience doesn't fully showcase the enhanced capabilities.

**Status**: Enhancement systems work perfectly - this is a chat router integration issue, not a fundamental system problem.
