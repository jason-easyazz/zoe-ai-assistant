## 📖 How to Use New Features

### Using Feedback Buttons

1. Chat with Zoe as normal
2. After each response, you'll see: 📋 Copy | 👍 Good | 👎 Bad | ✏️ Correct
3. Click 👍 if the response was good (reinforces that pattern)
4. Click 👎 if it was poor (learns to avoid)
5. Click ✏️ to provide the correct response (highest priority learning!)

### Viewing Training Status

1. Go to Settings → AI Training & Learning
2. See examples collected today
3. View training history
4. Export data if switching models

### Managing Models

```bash
# See what models you have
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py list

# Download a new model
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py pull qwen3:8b

# Set as default
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py set-default qwen3:8b

# View adapters
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py list-adapters

# Check current config
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py info
```

### Using Graph Engine (for developers)

```python
from graph_engine import graph_engine

# Find how two people are connected
path = graph_engine.find_path("person_1", "person_5")

# Find people within 2 connections of Sarah
nearby = graph_engine.search_by_proximity("person_sarah", max_depth=2)

# Who are the most connected people?
central = graph_engine.centrality_ranking(node_type="person", limit=10)

# Find friend-of-friend suggestions
suggestions = graph_engine.suggest_connections("person_john")

# Get graph statistics
stats = graph_engine.get_stats()
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Model Portability

**Q:** If I switch from llama3.2-1b to gemma3:1b, do I lose training?

**A:** 
- ❌ The LoRA adapter won't work (model-specific)
- ✅ Your training DATA is portable!
- ✅ Just retrain the new model on your collected examples
- ✅ Export data before switching: Settings → Export Training Data

### Privacy & Data

- All training data stays local on your Pi
- Never leaves your network
- Tied to your user_id
- Can be exported/deleted anytime

### Performance Impact

- ⚡ **Daytime:** Zero impact (just logging)
- 🌙 **Training time:** 2-4 hours (while you sleep)
- 💾 **Storage:** ~10-50MB per adapter
- 🧠 **Memory:** ~100MB during training

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Feedback buttons not working?

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `/api/chat/feedback` endpoint is accessible
3. Make sure interaction_id is returned in chat response

### Training not running?

1. Check cron is configured: `crontab -l`
2. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/zoe-training.log`
3. Verify minimum examples threshold met
4. Check Unsloth is installed: `pip list | grep unsloth`

### Graph engine issues?

1. Check NetworkX installed: `pip list | grep networkx`
2. Verify SQLite database exists: `ls -lh /app/data/zoe.db`
3. Check logs for graph loading errors
