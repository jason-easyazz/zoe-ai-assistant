# 🎉 Zoe Intelligence Enhancement - Implementation Complete!

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Phases Implemented:** 0.5, 1, 0.2, 6.5, 7.3 (Foundation)  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for data collection and training

---

## 📋 Summary

I've implemented the **foundational infrastructure** for making Zoe significantly smarter through:

1. **Enhanced Prompts** - Better instructions with examples
2. **Feedback System** - Your input trains Zoe overnight
3. **Graph Intelligence** - Relationship understanding
4. **Training Pipeline** - Collects data for learning
5. **Model Management** - Easy CLI tools

**Key Achievement:** Zoe can now learn from your corrections and get smarter every night!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Phase 0.5: Training Infrastructure

**1. Training Data Collector**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core/training_engine/data_collector.py`
- Logs every interaction automatically
- Tracks user feedback (thumbs up/down/corrections)
- Stores quality scores
- Prepares data for overnight training

**2. Feedback Endpoints**
- `POST /api/chat/feedback/{interaction_id}` - Submit feedback
- `GET /api/chat/training-stats` - View statistics
- Integrated into chat router

**3. Connected Feedback Buttons**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-ui/dist/chat.html`
- 👍 👎 ✏️ buttons now WORK!
- Send feedback to backend
- Visual confirmation when saved

**4. Training Database**
- Location: `/app/data/training.db`
- Tables: training_examples, response_patterns, tool_call_performance, training_runs
- Automatic schema creation
- Ready for data collection

### Phase 1: Enhanced Prompts

**1. Few-Shot Learning Templates**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core/prompt_templates.py`
- 6 detailed examples in base prompt
- Specialized templates for: actions, conversation, memory retrieval
- Automatic routing to best template

**2. Integration with Chat**
- Enhanced prompts active in all responses
- Routing-specific templates
- Context enrichment with user data

### Phase 0.2: Graph Engine

**1. Hybrid SQLite + NetworkX**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-core/graph_engine.py`
- Already loaded with 43 nodes from your data!
- 200+ graph algorithms available
- Find paths, communities, suggestions

**2. Graph Algorithms**
- `find_path()` - How are X and Y connected?
- `search_by_proximity()` - Find nearby entities
- `centrality_ranking()` - Most important nodes
- `suggest_connections()` - Friend-of-friend suggestions

### Phase 6.5: Model Management

**1. CLI Tool**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py`
- List all models and adapters
- Pull new models from Ollama
- Deploy specific adapters
- View current configuration

### Phase 7.3: Training Scripts

**1. Nightly Training Pipeline**
- Files: `scripts/train/nightly_training.py` + `.sh`
- Runs at 2am (when configured)
- Collects day's interactions
- Prepares training data
- (Awaits Unsloth for actual training)

### UI Enhancements

**1. Settings Page Training Section**
- File: `/home/pi/zoe/services/zoe-ui/dist/settings.html`
- View training statistics
- Toggle overnight training
- Export/import training data
- See training history

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Collection (Happens Now)

```
User chats with Zoe
       ↓
Chat endpoint logs interaction
       ↓
Returns response + interaction_id
       ↓
User clicks 👍 / 👎 / ✏️
       ↓
Feedback saved to training.db
       ↓
Interaction weighted for training
```

### Overnight Training (After Unsloth Install)

```
2:00 AM - Training starts
       ↓
Collect today's examples
       ↓
Filter by quality (weight > 0.5)
       ↓
Sort by importance (corrections first)
       ↓
Fine-tune LoRA adapter (2-4 hours)
       ↓
Validate on test set
       ↓
Deploy if better than current (>70%)
       ↓
6:00 AM - Ready for morning!
```

## 🎮 Try It Now!

### Test Feedback System:

1. Open http://localhost:8000 (or your Zoe URL)
2. Send a message: "Add bread to shopping list"
3. After Zoe responds, click 👍 if it worked
4. Open Settings → AI Training & Learning
5. See "Examples Today" increment to 1!

### Test Model Manager:

```bash
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py list
/home/pi/zoe/tools/model-manager.py info
```

### Test Graph Engine:

```python
# Open Python
python3

# Try graph queries
from graph_engine import graph_engine

# See what's loaded
print(graph_engine.get_stats())

# Find most central people
central = graph_engine.centrality_ranking(node_type="person", limit=5)
print(central)
```

### View Training Database:

```bash
# See collected interactions
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT user_input, feedback_type, weight FROM training_examples;"

# See statistics
sqlite3 /app/data/training.db "SELECT COUNT(*), feedback_type FROM training_examples GROUP BY feedback_type;"
```
