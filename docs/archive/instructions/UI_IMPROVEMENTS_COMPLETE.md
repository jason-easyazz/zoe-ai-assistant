4. **Smart Defaults**: Provides intelligent fallback suggestions

### Example Intelligence

// If user has 3 events today:
"I have 3 events today. Help me plan my day around them and any tasks I need to complete."

// If user has 5+ pending tasks:
"I have 7 pending tasks. Help me prioritize and schedule them effectively."

// If user has people in memory:
"Help me review my relationships and suggest ways to strengthen connections."
```

        fetch('/api/calendar/events?...'),
        fetch('/api/lists/personal_todos'),
        fetch('/api/memories/proxy/people')

## üö® 404 Error Resolution

### Root Cause
The 404 errors were caused by:
1. **Container not running** - zoe-core was stopped
2. **Browser cache** - Old JavaScript still executing

### Resolution
1. ‚úÖ **Container**: zoe-core is now running and healthy
2. ‚úÖ **API**: Sessions endpoint working (`/api/chat/sessions/`)
3. ‚úÖ **Cache**: Updated to v3.0 with cache busting

### Verification
```bash
‚úÖ Health Check: {"status": "healthy", "service": "zoe-core-enhanced"}
‚úÖ Sessions API: {"sessions": [], "count": 0}
‚úÖ Messages API: Working (tested with curl)
```
