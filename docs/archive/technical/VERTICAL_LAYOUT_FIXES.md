# Vertical Layout Fixes for Events and Tasks Widgets

## Issue Identified
The events and tasks widgets were not displaying their content vertically as expected. Items were either not showing up or not properly stacked vertically.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Loading Widget CSS Conflict**: The `.loading-widget` class had `min-height: 200px` and flexbox centering that interfered with content display
2. **Missing Class Removal**: When content was loaded, the `loading-widget` class wasn't being removed from the content containers
3. **CSS Inheritance Issues**: The loading widget styles were persisting even after content was loaded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated CSS for Content Areas
```css
/* Widget Content Areas */
#eventsContent, #tasksContent {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    padding: 8px;
    overflow-y: auto;
    max-height: 200px;
    min-height: auto; /* Override loading widget min-height */
}

/* Remove loading widget styles when content is loaded */
#eventsContent:not(.loading-widget), #tasksContent:not(.loading-widget) {
    align-items: stretch;
    justify-content: flex-start;
}
```

### 2. Updated JavaScript Functions
**Events Widget (`updateEvents`)**:
- Added `content.classList.remove('loading-widget');` to remove loading styles
- Ensures proper vertical layout after content loads

**Tasks Widget (`updateTasks`)**:
- Added `content.classList.remove('loading-widget');` to remove loading styles
- Maintains horizontal layout within each task row but stacks rows vertically

### 3. Layout Structure
**Events Layout** (Vertical):
- Each event displays vertically with time and title
- Events are stacked vertically in the widget
- Clean separation between events

**Tasks Layout** (Mixed):
- Each task row is horizontal (checkbox + title + priority)
- Task rows are stacked vertically in the widget
- Maintains usability while showing multiple tasks

## Expected Results
- ✅ Events display vertically with proper spacing
- ✅ Tasks display as horizontal rows stacked vertically
- ✅ No loading widget styling interference
- ✅ Proper scrolling when content exceeds widget height
- ✅ Clean visual hierarchy and readability

## Testing
The fixes ensure that:
1. Loading states display properly with centered spinner
2. Content loads and displays vertically as intended
3. No CSS conflicts between loading and content states
4. Proper scrolling behavior for long lists
5. Consistent styling across all widget types

The widgets now properly display their content in a vertical layout that matches the expected user experience.
