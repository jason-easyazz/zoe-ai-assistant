### Conversation

**👤 User:** "What did we accomplish this week?"

**🤖 Zoe:** "Great question! Let me walk you through the week:

Monday - You had the morning standup where the team decided to focus on the authentication module first and agreed to daily syncs at 10am.

Tuesday - You completed the authentication backend with all tests passing, then started on the frontend integration.

Wednesday - The frontend auth flow is now working! Alice tested it and found a password reset bug, which you fixed by end of day.

You've made excellent progress on authentication this week!"

---

**👤 User:** "When did we decide on the sprint goals?"

**🤖 Zoe:** "That was decided during Monday morning's standup meeting. The team decided to focus on the authentication module first."

## 🎯 Conversation 5: Preference-Based Recommendations

### Setup
```bash
# Store user preferences
POST /api/memories/?type=notes
{
  "note": {
    "title": "My Preferences",
    "content": "I prefer Python over JavaScript. Love working on backend systems. Interested in AI/ML. Enjoy hiking and photography in free time.",
    "category": "personal"
  }
}

POST /api/memories/?type=notes
{
  "note": {
    "title": "Learning Goals",
    "content": "Want to learn: Rust for systems programming, Computer Vision with OpenCV, Cloud architecture (AWS/GCP).",
    "category": "goals"
  }
}
```

### Conversation

**👤 User:** "What programming language should I use for my next project?"

**🤖 Zoe:** "Based on what I know about you, I'd recommend Python! You've mentioned you prefer it over JavaScript and love working on backend systems. Since you're interested in AI/ML, Python would be perfect for that. Plus, if you want to explore one of your learning goals, you could try Rust for a more systems-level project - it would complement your backend skills nicely!"

---

**👤 User:** "Can you suggest a weekend project for me?"

**🤖 Zoe:** "How about combining your interests? You could build a computer vision project using Python and OpenCV - maybe something that processes your hiking and photography images! For example:
- Automatic photo classifier for your hiking trips
- Object detection to identify wildlife in your photos
- Or a simple ML model to categorize landscapes vs. wildlife shots

This would let you work on backend code (which you love), use Python (your preference), and tackle one of your learning goals (Computer Vision with OpenCV)!"

---

**👤 User:** "What should I learn next?"

**🤖 Zoe:** "Looking at your learning goals, I think Computer Vision with OpenCV would be a great next step! Here's why:
1. You already prefer Python (OpenCV works great with it)
2. It aligns with your AI/ML interests
3. You could apply it to your hiking photography hobby
4. It's more approachable than jumping straight to Rust or cloud architecture

Once you're comfortable with that, Rust would be an excellent follow-up - it'll challenge you in systems programming while still being valuable for backend work."

async def chat_with_memory(message: str, user_id: str):
    # 1. Retrieve relevant memories
    memories = await search_memories(message, user_id)
    
    # 2. Build context
    context = build_context_from_memories(memories)
    
    # 3. Generate response with LLM
    response = await llm.generate(
        system_prompt="You are Zoe, an AI with perfect memory",
        context=context,
        user_message=message
    )
    
    return response
