```bash
# Get token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"test"}' | jq -r '.access_token')

# Store a memory
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/memories/?type=people" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "person": {
      "name": "Sarah",
      "relationship": "friend",
      "notes": "Loves Arduino projects, especially temperature sensors"
    }
  }'

# Retrieve it
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/memories/?type=people" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

## 💬 Example Conversations (From MEMORY_DEMO.md)

### Conversation 1: Personal Details

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "person": {
    "name": "Sarah",
    "notes": "Friend who loves Arduino projects, especially temperature sensors"
  }
}
```

**User:** "What do you know about Sarah?"

**Zoe's Response:**
```
Sarah is your friend who loves Arduino projects! She's particularly interested in 
temperature sensors. Is there something specific about Sarah's projects you'd like 
to discuss?
```

**✅ Success:** Zoe recalled Sarah's name, relationship, and interests naturally.

---

### Conversation 2: Project Tracking

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "Greenhouse Automation",
    "description": "Arduino-based system with temperature control",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

**User:** "What project am I working on?"

**Zoe's Response:**
```
You're working on Greenhouse Automation! It's an Arduino-based system focused on 
temperature control. The project is currently active. Would you like to update 
me on any progress?
```

**✅ Success:** Zoe recalled project name, description, and current status.

---

### Conversation 3: Cross-Referencing

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "person": {"name": "Sarah", "notes": "Loves Arduino"},
  "project": {"name": "Greenhouse", "description": "Arduino temperature control"},
  "note": {"content": "Discussed project with Sarah yesterday"}
}
```

**User:** "Who can help me with my greenhouse project?"

**Zoe's Response:**
```
Sarah would be perfect! She loves Arduino projects and you actually discussed 
the greenhouse project with her yesterday. Since your project involves Arduino-based 
temperature control, it's right up her alley.
```

**✅ Success:** Zoe connected person (Sarah) → interest (Arduino) → project (Greenhouse)

---

### Conversation 4: Timeline Awareness

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "notes": [
    {"title": "Monday", "content": "Started greenhouse sensor setup"},
    {"title": "Tuesday", "content": "Sarah helped debug temperature readings"},
    {"title": "Wednesday", "content": "System working! All sensors calibrated"}
  ]
}
```

**User:** "What progress did we make this week?"

**Zoe's Response:**
```
Great question! Here's your week:

Monday - You started setting up the greenhouse sensors
Tuesday - Sarah helped you debug the temperature readings
Wednesday - Success! The system is now working with all sensors calibrated

You went from setup to fully functional in just 3 days!
```

**✅ Success:** Zoe maintained chronological order and summarized progress.

---

### Conversation 5: Contextual Recommendations

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "notes": [
    {"content": "I prefer Arduino over Raspberry Pi for sensors"},
    {"content": "Interested in learning about soil moisture monitoring"}
  ]
}
```

**User:** "What should I add to my greenhouse next?"

**Zoe's Response:**
```
Based on what I know about you, I'd suggest soil moisture monitoring! You mentioned 
wanting to learn about it, and since you prefer Arduino (which you're already using 
for temperature), you could add moisture sensors to the same system. This would give 
you complete environmental control of your greenhouse.
```

**✅ Success:** Zoe used preferences (Arduino preference) + goals (learn soil moisture) → personalized recommendation.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### How Memory Recall Works

```python
# 1. User asks a question
user_message = "What do you know about Sarah?"

# 2. System retrieves relevant memories
memories = db.query("""
    SELECT * FROM memories 
    WHERE user_id = ? 
    AND (name LIKE '%Sarah%' OR notes LIKE '%Sarah%')
""", user_id)

# 3. Build context for LLM
context = f"""
You are Zoe, an AI assistant with perfect memory.

What you remember about Sarah:
- Name: Sarah
- Relationship: Friend
- Notes: Loves Arduino projects, especially temperature sensors

User asks: {user_message}

Respond naturally and helpfully:
"""

# 4. LLM generates contextual response
response = llm.generate(context)
# Output: "Sarah is your friend who loves Arduino projects..."
```

## 🎯 What Makes This "Samantha-Level"

### 1. **Natural Language** ✅
- Not robotic: "Sarah is your friend who..." vs "RECORD FOUND: NAME=SARAH"
- Conversational tone with personality

### 2. **Contextual Awareness** ✅
- Doesn't just retrieve data
- Understands relationships between memories
- Makes connections (Sarah + Arduino → can help with project)

### 3. **Temporal Understanding** ✅
- Tracks Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday
- Summarizes progress naturally
- Understands "this week" vs "yesterday"

### 4. **Preference Learning** ✅
- Remembers "I prefer Arduino over..."
- Uses preferences for recommendations
- Learns over time

### 5. **Proactive Helpfulness** ✅
- Suggests next steps
- Offers related information
- Asks clarifying questions

## 🚀 Try It Right Now

### Quick 3-Step Test

**Step 1:** Store a memory
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/memories/?type=people \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"person": {"name": "Alex", "notes": "Python expert, loves ML"}}'
```

**Step 2:** Retrieve it
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/memories/?type=people \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Step 3:** Ask Zoe about it
```bash
# In the UI or via API
"What do you know about Alex?"

# Expected: "Alex is a Python expert who loves machine learning!"
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Zoe demonstrates TRUE "Samantha from Her" level memory:**

✅ Stores everything perfectly  
✅ Recalls context naturally  
✅ Makes intelligent connections  
✅ Maintains temporal awareness  
✅ Provides personalized recommendations  
✅ Speaks conversationally, not robotically  

### The Difference

**Traditional AI:**
> "I found 1 record matching 'Sarah'. Name: Sarah. Notes: Loves Arduino."

**Zoe (Samantha-level):**
> "Sarah is your friend who loves Arduino projects! She's particularly interested 
> in temperature sensors. Since you're working on the greenhouse automation, 
> she'd be perfect to help - you actually discussed it with her yesterday!"
