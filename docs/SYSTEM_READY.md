## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### Immediate (No Action Needed):

✅ All systems are operational
✅ Feedback collection is active
✅ Overnight jobs are scheduled
✅ Enhanced prompts are working

**Just use Zoe normally!**

### Optional (For Actual Training):

**When ready for LoRA fine-tuning:**

```bash
# Install Unsloth (one-time, ~5-10 minutes)
pip install unsloth

# That's it! Training will work automatically
```

**Without Unsloth:**
- ✅ Everything else works perfectly
- ✅ Data collection continues
- ✅ Training data saved for future
- ⏳ Actual model training waits for Unsloth
