## 🎯 How Experts + LLMs + MCP Work Together

### Integration Architecture

```
User Natural Language Query
        ↓
Chat Router (orchestrator)
        ↓
    ┌───┴───┐
    ↓       ↓
Enhanced    LLM (RouteLLM)
MemAgent    ↓
    ↓       Choose: Ollama (fast) or Claude (complex)
9 Experts   ↓
    ↓       Generate Response
Execute     ↓
Actions ←───┘
    ↓
MCP Server (15+ tools)
    ↓
Result: Intelligent, Fast, Natural Response
```

### Example Flow

**Simple Action** (Expert handles):
```
"Add bread to shopping list"
→ ListExpert (0.95 confidence)
→ POST /api/lists/shopping
→ Done in 200ms (no LLM needed!)
```

**Complex Query** (LLM handles):
```
"What should I do this weekend based on weather?"
→ No expert (low confidence)
→ LLM + WeatherExpert context
→ LLM generates intelligent suggestion
```

**Mixed** (Both):
```
"Remember John and tell me about him"
→ PersonExpert creates John
→ LLM generates: "I'll remember John - your colleague who loves Python!"
```
