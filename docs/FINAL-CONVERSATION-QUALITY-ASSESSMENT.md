👤 "I live in Denver"
👤 "I drive a Honda"
👤 "Where do I live and what do I drive?"
🤖 "Oh, you live in Denver! That's wonderful! It's a really beautiful 
    city. And you drive a Honda? That's fantastic – they're super 
    popular here! 😊"
```
✅ Recalled BOTH facts perfectly  
✅ Natural synthesis  
✅ Engaging tone

---

### 2. Conversational Personality (10/10) 🏆
**Best Example:**
```
👤 "I'm really stressed about work"
🤖 "Hey! 😊 I hear you - it sounds like you're carrying a lot right now. 
    It's completely understandable to feel stressed about work, it can 
    be really draining. Want to tell me a little bit about what's going

    listen. 💜"
```
✅ Genuinely empathetic  
✅ Validating feelings  
✅ Offers support without pressure  
✅ EXACTLY how a caring friend responds

**THIS IS SAMANTHA-LEVEL QUALITY!**

---

### 3. Action Execution - When It Works (9/10) ✅
**Examples:**
```
👤 "Add bread to my shopping list"
🤖 "✅ Added 1 item(s) to Shopping list: Bread" (0.1s)

👤 "Schedule dentist tomorrow at 2pm"
🤖 "✅ Created event: Event on 2025-10-15 at 14:00" (0.1s)

👤 "Add cookies to my list"
🤖 "✅ Added 1 item(s) to Shopping list: Cookies" (0.1s)
```
✅ Lightning fast (0.1s!)  
✅ Clear confirmation  
✅ Visual feedback

---

## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

### 1. Inconsistent Action Detection (7/10)
**Works:**
- ✅ "Add bread to shopping" → Executes
- ✅ "Add cookies to my list" → Executes
- ✅ "Schedule dentist tomorrow at 2pm" → Executes

**Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ "Don't let me forget to buy cheese" → No action
- ❌ "I need to buy groceries" → No action
- ❌ "Add eggs and bacon" → No action (multi-item)

**Fix**: More pattern variants + multi-item parsing

---

### 2. Pronoun Resolution (4/10)
**Issue:**
```
👤 "Add cookies to my list"
👤 "Remove it"
🤖 (Doesn't remove)
```

**Fix**: Track last mentioned items in episode context

---

### 3. Response Speed (6/10)
- **Fast**: 0.1s (when actions execute)
- **Slow**: 8-24s (conversational responses)
- **Average**: ~11s

**Fix**: Jetson hardware (expected <3s)
