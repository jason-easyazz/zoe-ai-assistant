I need to continue working on my Zoe AI Assistant.

Current state from my system:

📝 Last Commit: 220e9cb 📚 Added permanent project instructions and continuity system
⏰ State Generated: Wed 20 Aug 21:47:18 AWST 2025
```

System Architecture:
- Docker containers with zoe- prefix
- Single docker-compose.yml
- SQLite database at data/zoe.db
- Services: FastAPI backend, Nginx frontend, Ollama AI, Redis cache

Please:
1. Load the Zoe project documents from your knowledge
2. Acknowledge the current state above
3. Show available enhancement options
4. Provide complete scripts with GitHub auto-sync

All scripts should:
- Start with: cd /home/pi/zoe
- End with: git push
- Include full file contents
- Test immediately after changes

What would you like me to work on next?
