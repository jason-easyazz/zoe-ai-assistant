## 🧪 Test Results (Verified Oct 8, 2025 11:40 AM)

### API Endpoint Tests: ✅ 10/10 PASSING (100%)
- ✅ Health Check, Database, Docker Services
- ✅ Lists API (all 4 list types working)
- ✅ Calendar API, Reminders API
- ✅ Chat API (basic & streaming)
- ✅ Ollama (14 models available)
- ✅ UI Files (all present)

### Chat UI Integration Tests: ⚠️ 5/10 PASSING (50%)

**✅ Working Through Natural Language (5/10)**:
- ✅ "Add bread to shopping list" - Works
- ✅ "Create event on Oct 24th" - Works
- ✅ "Remind me tomorrow at 10am" - Works
- ✅ Basic memory search - Works
- ✅ List queries - Works

**❌ Not Working Through Chat (5/10)**:
- ❌ "Create a person named John Smith" - Not creating memories
- ❌ Complex multi-step tasks - Timeouts (30s+)
- ❌ "What did I just ask you?" - No temporal context recall
- ❌ "What events do I have?" - Timeouts
- ❌ Some general queries - Timeouts

---

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations (100% Accurate - Oct 8, 2025)

### Critical Issues
- ❌ **Chat Timeouts**: 30% of queries timeout on complex requests
- ❌ **No Temporal Memory in Chat**: Doesn't recall previous conversation
- ❌ **Enhancement Systems Not Integrated**: APIs exist but chat doesn't call them
- ⚠️ **zoe-auth Unhealthy**: Docker health check fails (but auth works)

### What Works vs What Doesn't

**✅ WORKING**:
- API endpoints (all 100% functional)
- Simple chat commands (shopping, calendar, reminders)
- Basic AI responses
- Service infrastructure
- Database operations

**❌ NOT WORKING**:
- Temporal memory through chat
- Complex multi-step orchestration through chat
- Person/memory creation via natural language
- Some AI query types (timeouts)

### Root Cause
The chat router exists but **doesn't integrate with enhancement systems**. The APIs are there, the systems work, but the chat UI doesn't use them.
