# Zoe AI Assistant Development Rules
# These rules ensure safe, maintainable, and efficient code
# Updated: November 10, 2025 - Added Multi-Platform Hardware Support

## 🛡️ FILE ORGANIZATION & CLEANUP SAFETY - MANDATORY

### BEFORE Touching ANY Files:
1. Check if file in manifest: .zoe/manifest.json
2. Run validator: python3 tools/audit/validate_structure.py
3. If not in manifest: ASK USER before proceeding
4. NEVER assume a file is safe to delete

### NEVER Delete Without Validation:
- Run: python3 tools/audit/validate_critical_files.py
- Run: bash tools/audit/find_file_references.sh <filename>
- Create safety commit BEFORE cleanup: git commit -am "Pre-cleanup safety"
- Work in feature branch, NOT main: git checkout -b cleanup-YYYYMMDD
- Delete max 5-10 files at a time
- Test after EACH deletion (check browser console F12)

### CRITICAL FILES (Never Delete):
- services/zoe-ui/dist/css/**/*.css (ALL CSS files)
- services/zoe-ui/dist/js/**/*.js (ALL JavaScript files)
- services/zoe-ui/dist/js/widgets/core/**/*.js (ALL widget files)
- services/zoe-ui/dist/components/**/*.html (ALL components)
- services/zoe-ui/dist/*.html (ALL HTML pages)
- services/zoe-core/main.py, routers/chat.py, ai_client.py
- docker-compose.yml, .env, nginx.conf

### PROHIBITED PATTERNS (Never Commit):
- *_backup.*, *_old.*, *_v2.*, *_new.*, *_fixed.*
- ._* (Mac metadata files)
- *.log, *.tmp (logs don't belong in repo)
- *.jar, *.sql, *.conf in project root
- test_*.py in project root (use tests/ directory)

### CLEANUP PROCESS (Mandatory Steps):
1. Dry-run: python3 tools/cleanup/safe_cleanup.py
2. Review ALL proposed deletions with user
3. Get explicit user approval for each category
4. Execute: python3 tools/cleanup/safe_cleanup.py --execute
5. Commit with detailed message listing what was removed and why
6. Validate: python3 tools/audit/validate_structure.py

### FILE STRUCTURE RULES:
- Root has MAX 10 .md files (currently 6/10 - compliant)
- Tests go in tests/{unit|integration|performance|e2e}/
- Scripts go in scripts/{setup|maintenance|deployment|security|utilities}/
- Docs go in docs/{guides|api|architecture|governance|archive}/
- Tools go in tools/{audit|cleanup|validation|generators}/
- **NEW DOCUMENTATION**: Always place in docs/{category}/, NEVER in root

## 🏛️ ARCHITECTURE RULES

### Single Source of Truth:
- ONLY ONE chat router: services/zoe-core/routers/chat.py
- NEVER create chat_v2.py, chat_new.py, chat_optimized.py
- Use git branches for changes, NOT file duplication
- Backup files must use git, not file copying

### Intelligent Systems (Use Them, Don't Replace):
- MemAgentClient for semantic memory search
- EnhancedMemAgentClient for action execution
- ExpertOrchestrator for multi-step task coordination
- AgentPlanner for task decomposition
- RouteLLM for intelligent model selection
- MCP Server for tool-based actions
- NEVER hardcode regex patterns or canned responses in chat.py
- Let specialized systems do their jobs

### No Hardcoding:
- NO "if/else" command detection in chat router
- Use LLM + Agent system for natural language understanding
- Example WRONG: if "add" in message and "shopping" in message: return "Added"
- Example RIGHT: result = await enhanced_mem_agent.execute_action(message, user_id)

## Security Rules
- Never hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Never execute user input directly as code

## File System Safety
- Don't use os.remove() without confirmation
- Don't use shutil.rmtree() without backup verification
- Always check file existence before operations
- Use safe file paths (no ../ or absolute paths from user input)
- Don't overwrite critical system files

## Docker & Container Safety
- Don't run `docker rm -f` without explicit confirmation
- Don't run `docker system prune` or `docker prune -f`
- Always backup before destructive operations
- Don't modify running containers without stopping them first
- Don't delete volumes without backup

## Database Safety
- Don't use DROP TABLE without confirmation
- Don't use DELETE without WHERE clause
- Always backup before schema changes
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Don't truncate tables without backup

## Code Quality
- Add error handling for all risky operations
- Use type hints for function parameters
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Use meaningful variable names

## Performance
- Don't run blocking operations in main thread
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Don't load large files into memory at once
- Use generators for large data processing
- Cache expensive operations

## Testing
- Test all new functionality
- Add unit tests for critical functions
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify rollback procedures work
- Test with different user permissions

## Documentation
- Update README for new features
- Document API changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Keep architecture diagrams current
- Document configuration options

## Error Handling
- Always handle exceptions gracefully
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Provide helpful error messages to users
- Don't expose internal system details
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms

## Memory Management
- Don't create memory leaks
- Clean up resources properly
- Use context managers for file operations
- Don't store large objects in global scope
- Monitor memory usage in long-running processes

## 🎯 GOLDEN RULES

1. When in doubt, DON'T delete - move to docs/archive/ instead
2. Test BEFORE committing - one broken deployment is worse than clutter
3. Small commits - easy to revert, easy to review
4. Document reasoning - future you will thank present you
5. Use git history - don't duplicate files, use version control
6. Validate after changes - run structure validator before commit
7. Prevention > Recovery - use pre-commit hooks
8. **MULTI-PLATFORM**: Code must work on BOTH Jetson Orin NX AND Raspberry Pi 5

## 🖥️ HARDWARE PLATFORM RULES - MANDATORY

### Dual Platform Support
Zoe runs on TWO platforms simultaneously:
- **Jetson Orin NX 16GB**: GPU-accelerated, TensorRT, production
- **Raspberry Pi 5 16GB**: CPU-only, edge deployment, development

### Hardware-Specific Code Requirements

**ALWAYS check hardware before:**
- Setting GPU configurations (`num_gpu`)
- Loading models (different models for each platform)
- Using CUDA/TensorRT features
- Setting performance parameters

**Use environment variable**: `HARDWARE_PLATFORM=jetson|pi5|auto`

**Example Pattern**:
```python
import os
HARDWARE = os.getenv('HARDWARE_PLATFORM', 'auto')

if HARDWARE == 'jetson':
    # GPU-accelerated path
    model_config = {"num_gpu": 99, "use_tensorrt": True}
elif HARDWARE == 'pi5':
    # CPU-optimized path
    model_config = {"num_gpu": 0, "num_threads": 4}
```

### Model Selection Rules

**Jetson Models** (GPU-accelerated):
- Primary: `hermes3:8b-llama3.1-q4_K_M` (4.9GB)
- Chat: `gemma3n-e2b-gpu-fixed` (5.6GB, num_gpu=99)
- Vision: `gemma3n-e2b-gpu-fixed` (multimodal)
- Memory: `qwen2.5:7b` (4.7GB)

**Pi5 Models** (CPU-optimized):
- Primary: `phi3:mini` (2.2GB, num_gpu=0)
- Chat: `phi3:mini` (fast on CPU)
- Vision: `llava:7b-v1.6-q4` (CPU-compatible)
- Memory: `qwen2.5:3b` (2.0GB)

### Testing Rules

**MUST test on BOTH platforms before merge:**
1. Jetson: GPU usage, TensorRT compatibility
2. Pi5: CPU usage, memory constraints
3. Both: Feature parity (where possible)
4. Both: Health checks pass

### Docker Rules

**Separate docker-compose files**:
- `docker-compose.jetson.yml` - GPU configs
- `docker-compose.pi5.yml` - CPU configs
- `docker-compose.yml` - Base (auto-detect)

**Image selection**:
- Jetson: Use `dustynv/ollama:r36.2.0` (Jetson-optimized)
- Pi5: Use `ollama/ollama:latest` (standard ARM)

### Feature Flags

**Use hardware-aware feature flags**:
```python
FEATURES = {
    'tensorrt': HARDWARE == 'jetson',
    'gpu_acceleration': HARDWARE == 'jetson',
    'multi_model_concurrent': HARDWARE == 'jetson',
    'aggressive_unload': HARDWARE == 'pi5',
}
```

### Documentation Rules

**When adding features, document**:
- ✅ Works on Jetson: [feature details]
- ✅ Works on Pi5: [feature details]
- ⚠️ Jetson-only: [reason, Pi5 alternative]
- ⚠️ Pi5-only: [reason, Jetson alternative]

### Performance Targets (by platform)

**Jetson Orin NX**:
- First token: <2s (with TensorRT)
- Tokens/sec: 50+
- Max model: 8GB
- Concurrent: 5+ requests

**Raspberry Pi 5**:
- First token: <5s (CPU)
- Tokens/sec: 8-12
- Max model: 4GB
- Concurrent: 2-3 requests

### Critical Files

**Hardware detection**: Check before modifying
- `services/zoe-core/model_config.py` (model selection)
- `services/zoe-core/model_prewarm.py` (pre-warming)
- `docker-compose.yml` (service configs)
- `.env` (platform settings)

**See**: `HARDWARE_COMPATIBILITY.md` for full details

## 📋 BEFORE EVERY COMMIT

The pre-commit hook will automatically check:
- Project structure validation (validate_structure.py)
- Critical files exist (validate_critical_files.py)
- No junk file patterns (._*, *_backup, *_old)

If pre-commit fails, FIX the issues before committing.
NEVER bypass hooks with --no-verify.

## 🆘 IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING

1. STOP immediately
2. Document what was deleted
3. Run recovery: git show <commit>^:path/to/file > path/to/file
4. Validate restoration: python3 tools/audit/validate_critical_files.py
5. Test thoroughly before continuing

## ✅ MANDATORY PRE-ACTION CHECKLIST

**BEFORE creating/modifying/deleting ANY files:**
1. Read `.zoe/AI_ASSISTANT_CHECKLIST.md` (mandatory checklist)
2. Check root .md count: `ls -1 *.md | wc -l` (must be ≤ 10)
3. Validate structure: `python3 tools/audit/validate_structure.py`
4. Check manifest: `.zoe/manifest.json` for approved files
5. For new documentation: Place in `docs/{category}/`, NEVER in root
